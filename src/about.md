Hi,  
I am Andr√© a passionate front-end developer.  
I love challenges and to learn.  
I started as a self-thought developer and had a (very) steep learning curve at my current job where I had the opportunity to learn and directly influenced most of the current web-fronted.   
I value being in an open, fun environment,  
with a team eager to learn from each other.
