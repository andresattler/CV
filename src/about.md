Hi I am Andr√© and I am on my way to become an self-thought Javascript Developer.
I really love to face new challenges and I learn really fast new skills
on my way.
I have started at the beginning of 2016 to learn about web development.
In October 2016 I've completed the FreeCodeCamp Front-End Program and earned the Front End
FreeCodeCamp program and finished the Front-End Certificate
Since then I am realizing various personal projects to show on my portfolio.
In the last year I've been discovering New Zealand by feet but this didn't stop me developing. I've participated on various Code Challenges from it-talents.de and earned the third place with my facebook chatbot in June 2017.
