Hi I am André and I‘m on my way to become an self-thought Front-End
Developer. I really love to face new challenges and I learn really fast new skills
on my way.
I have started at the beginning of 2016 to learn about web development first on
codeacademy before I’ve started the FreeCodeCamp program and finished the
Front End Certificate in October 2016.
Since then I realize various own projects like my portfolio. In the last time I’m
mostly focusing on learning React. So I’ve developed a react-based static - site -
generator for my blog and a picture gallery using react-router.
