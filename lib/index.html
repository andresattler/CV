Developer. I really love to face new challenges and I learn really fast new skills
on my way.
I have started at the beginning of 2016 to learn about web development first on
codeacademy before I’ve started the FreeCodeCamp program and finished the
F ron t E nd Certificate in October 2016.
Since then I realize various own projects like my portfolio. In the last time I’m
mostly focusing on learning React. So I’ve developed a react-based static - site -
generator for my blog and a picture gallery using react-router.</p>
